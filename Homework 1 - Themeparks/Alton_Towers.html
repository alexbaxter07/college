<h3>Alton Towers History</h3>

<p>The grounds at Alton Towers were first opened to the public by the 18th Earl in 1860. By 1890 Alton Towers was attracting crowds of 30,000 to watch acrobats, lion tamers, elephants, bands and fireworks, as well as the gardens. In the early 1900s the 20th Earl, who had interests in the Talbot Motor Car Company which he had founded, began to spend more and more time at his Ingestre Estate. Lady Shrewsbury lived alone at the Towers until 1923 after her husband's death in 1921. Although the bulk of the estate had already been sold in 1918, in 1924 the remaining lands and Alton Towers itself were sold to a group of local businessmen. So, after some 700 years the Towers and the Estate passed out of the hands of the Earls of Shrewsbury.The house and gardens remained open until the outbreak of War when it was requisitioned as an Officer Cadet Training Camp. The Ministry of Defence retained possession of the buildings until the mid 1950's when, after some legal argument over the condition of the towers, it was finally returned to the then owners, Alton Towers Ltd, who continued to run it as a successful business. Although the Park had become a well known tourist attraction throughout the '60s and '70s with its inclusion of travelling rides throughout the property as well as a boating lake and chairlift. It was not until 1980 that it became known as a Theme Park taking inspiration from Disney when designing the layout and theming for the park. They became known as a fully fledged theme park and put Alton Towers on the map when they introduction of the then revolutionary Corkscrew roller coaster.
